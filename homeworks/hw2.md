# HW02 - LDA Algorithm Implementation

- In this assignment, you must implement Algorithm 20.1 of Zaki's book with Python.
- Run the example 20.2 of the book with your own program and get the same w.
- Also display the original data, the vector corresponding to the optimal response and the data mapping on this vector.
- Also print the a_i 's that show the distance of the point mapping on the found vector to the origin.
- Do not use ```sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis``` function  to run LDA, other commands are allowed.
- Submit a jupyter notebook file that has been run and the results can be seen.

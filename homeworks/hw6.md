# HW06 - Classification of Persian Hoda digits with random forest

At the end of [this file](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.08-Random-Forests.ipynb), we saw the classification of English figures and the evaluation results with random forest.

Do the same on the [data set of Hoda's Farsi digits](http://farsiocr.ir/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C/).

1. Perform the classification of Persian digits with the random forest method.
2. Perform dimensionality reduction with PCA (eg reduce dimensionality to 64 dimensions) and then perform classification with random forest.

3. Display the Accuracy and Confusion Matrix in both methods and compare the results. Which method is more accurate?
